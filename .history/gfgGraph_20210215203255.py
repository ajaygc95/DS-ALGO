#graph 

'''
Vetex = Points circles
edge are lines
Weight = value of the lines lets say 5

G = (V,E)


Needed function 

class Graph()--> To store graph and weight 
addvertex(vert) --> Add Vertex  lets sas addvertex (A)
addEdgge() --> Add Edges   connects(A -> B )
addEdge() --> add Edges with weight (A -> B , )
